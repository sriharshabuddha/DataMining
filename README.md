# DataMining
There will be two sets of datasets for this projectâ€”one for classification models and the second for regression models.
Read data into Jupyter notebook using pandas to import data into a data frame.
Explore each data set using different descriptive and plotting methods.
Explore each dataset, check for missing data, and apply proper data imputation methods.
Apply the same preprocessing techniques on the classification_test and regression_test. Note that these two datasets don't have target columns.
Scale each dataset. Explain your choice of data scaling method.
Apply clustering methods discussed in class to study the structure of each dataset. Discuss how the outcome of clustering will help you better understand the structure of data. Provide result interpretation for each clustering model.
Regression dataset: Apply all the regression models you have learned in this class. Discuss the results and outcomes. Models with hyperparameters explain how you find the best value of the hyperparameters.
Find the best regression model among the list of models trained on the regression_train dataset. Use this model to predict the target values of the regression_test.
Classification dataset: Apply all the classification models you have learned in this course. Discuss the results and outcomes. Discuss the choice of evaluation method and how it helps you find the best values of the model hyperparameters.
Find the best classification model among the list of models trained on the classification_train dataset. Use this model to predict the target values of the classification_test.
